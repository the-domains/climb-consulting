**Linkedin GBL Page**

Your page looks good, with all the necessary information about your business.

I recommend starting to share all the articles you have in your blog. For example 1 every week or 1 every two weeks.

**Linkedin profile page**

**Anne**

Get to 500+ connexions. When people look at your profile this is one of the first they see. Linkedin doesn't show more than 500 connexions and unconsciously you're saying how strong and influence your profile is.

Add some of the content you have on your Linkedin GBL Description Page to the Linkedin Description GBL job in your profile. You can also say a little bit more about your role on GBL.

**Helen**

Add some of the content you have on your Linkedin GBL Description Page to the Linkedin Description GBL job in your profile. You can also say a little bit more about your role on GBL.

Share content in your own profiles.

If Linkedin has enabled the publishing option to you, share the articles in your profile as well as in every group you joined that can be interested in that specific content. Helen, I think you can publish but I'm not sure about Anne.

**Twitter**

Improve the description of your profiles adding information about your position on GBL.

You could take advantage of the Twitter cover header section. Adding a professional image of you running a training can be an option or a background image with a quote and your website URL.
