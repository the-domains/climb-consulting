About Us

Perhaps the most important thing to know about me, is that my practice really isn't about me. My practice is about listening to small business owners and individuals about accounting and tax related matters, and making those matters understandable.

For what it is worth, my experience is largely around the happenstance of starting in the field at a time when most accountants were unfamiliar with the now defacto standard, QuickBooks. It is a lucky storyline to be 'born' in QuickBooks, and the mission is simple: transparency between the books and tax returns, or financial statements.

I often recommend Intuit branded products and services for one reason; they work best for providing "transactional tranquility" that make accounting accurate and easy to perform, in fewer steps.

As happenstance as falling into QuickBooks when I entered the field, I have been lucky to get to work with and get to know the wonderful individuals at Intuit who create, market, and support their products and services. I'm a past member of the Accountant Advisory Council for Intuit, I'm an Advanced Certified Pro-Advisor, I'm a CPA and Certified Valuation Analyst (CVA), and I'm a member of the 

Intuit Trainer/Writer Network

. More than all of those designations, I'm an understandable, likeable, down-to-earth proponent of outstanding accounting and tax returns.
