# Services

Today it is primarily the teamwork of partner bookkeepers and consultants that allow me to deliver accurate and timely tax returns.

Bookkeepers transform many transactions into ending balance bliss. I gain insight and expertise by listening to clients about what we, and the products and services we use, can do better. I'm proud of a practice that is primarily one-to-one client relationships. I'm simply a CPA who answers the phone.

I'm a disciple of the Intuit philosophy of listening to customers, and a fanatic of the benefits of an open exchange with clients on product and workflow improvement.

I began my practice many years ago, and I operate as much virtually, as from my home office. I worked in a large firm in Chico CA (Matson & Isom) after graduating from CSU, Chico and subsequently worked in a large Bay Area firm (Armanino LLP). I started solo to better support the QuickBooks and small business clientele.
